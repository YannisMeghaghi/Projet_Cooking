# Projet_Cooking

This is a school project in group of two in which we had to do a WPF application to manage a imaginary website. The concept was simple : there is two types of people, those who create recipes and those who don't. The creator of a recipe is credited each times a recipe he created was commanded. 
We didn't have to manage the delivery aspect of the application.

We coded it in C# on Visual Studio, our database in SQL on MySQL Workbench.
